Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic and self learning purposes

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning
	- [Predicting Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/boston_housing/boston_housing.ipynb): A model to predict the value of a given house in the Boston real estate market using various statistical analysis tools. Identified the best price that a client can sell their house utilizing machine learning.
	- [Supervised Learning: Finding Donors for CharityML](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/finding_donors/finding_donors.ipynb): Testing out several different supervised learning algorithms to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000, to identify likely donors for a fictional non-profit organisation.
	- [Unsupervised Learning: Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/customer_segments/customer_segments.ipynb): Analyzing a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for discovering internal structure, patterns and knowledge.
	
	_Tools: scikit-learn, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

- ### Data Analysis and Visualisation
	- [Scalable Walkability Analysis of Melbourne](https://github.com/sajal2692/Scalable-Walkability-Analysis-of-Melbourne): Analysis of walkability of suburbs in Melbourne, Victoria and its implications.
	- [Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Analysis](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Titanic%20Dataset%20-%20Exploratory%20Analysis.ipynb): Exploratory Analysis of the passengers onboard RMS Titanic using Pandas and Seaborn visualisations.
	- [Stock Market Analysis for Tech Stocks](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/Stock%20Market%20Analysis%20for%20Tech%20Stocks.ipynb): Analysis of technology stocks including change in price over time, daily returns, and stock behaviour prediction.
	- [2016 US General Election Poll Data Analysis](https://github.com/sajal2692/data-science-portfolio/blob/master/2016%20General%20Election%20Poll%20Analysis.ipynb): Very simple analysis of 2016 US General Election Poll data.
